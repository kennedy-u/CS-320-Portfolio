## Reflection

### How can I ensure that my codebase, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that the codebase, program, or software is functional and secure, developers should use an environment that suggests secure methods and reinforces security best practices through notifications in the environment. Also, developers should choose their programming language and framework based on the needs of the project and their company! An effective way to ensure the functionality of the software is that the developers need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their chosen language, so they understand the challenges and understand the integrity of the software in development.

I automated the process for this practice to make security best practices easier to adopt. The goal was to ensure that as I was developing, I was also able to raise flaws/errors during the natural development stage, rather than conduct security scans only at the end of the process. The test automation tools can be used as the software is being developed. 

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User's needs are like the software itself. User needs values to a product, service, or environment depending on the user's requirements. To incorporate user needs into a program, it is necessary to implement a system that will help users understand their problems and needs relating to the software. For example, functions, a user needs to understand the functionalities they wish to incorporate in developing software, so they can be able to specify what they need exactly, and this will help the developer understand the series of actions to implement at the initial stage. 

### How do I approach designing software?

Two approaches are normally used during the software designing stage, one is the Bottom-up approach, and this approach starts with simple or lowest-level components/subsystems of the development stage, for example. resources, things that matter to the software in development, abstract ideas, or even a real-life event senior might be incorporated into the software system. Then, the next will be to investigate the higher-level components and their subsystems as they contribute to the overall software development.
The next will be the Top-down approach, this approach will be overshadowing the bottom-up approach as it will address and implement division facilities that will form a system hierarchy structure. The top-down approach maintains design requirements to be responsive according to specifications.
